# Home Assistant Add-ons: Laqoore repository

Add-ons for Home Assistant, allow you to extend the functionality
around your Home Assistant setup. These add-ons can consist of an application
that Home Assistant can integrate with (e.g., a MQTT broker or database server)
or allow access to your Home Assistant configuration (e.g., via Samba or using
the Configurator).

Add-ons can be installed and configured via the Home Assistant frontend on
systems that have installed Home Assistant.
